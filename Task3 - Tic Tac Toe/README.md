# Task - Tic Tac Toe Game
This folder contains the source code for a simple Tic Tac Toe game written in C++.

## About
This Tic Tac Toe game allows two players to play against each other on the console. The game supports basic game state checks, such as checking for a win or a draw.

## Files
- `main.cpp` - Entry point for the application. Contains the game loop and handles user input.

## How to run
The game was developed using Visual Studio Code and C++. To run it:

1. Open `main.cpp` in Visual Studio Code (or any other IDE/text editor).
2. Build the project.
3. Run it to launch the game.

The location of the generated executable file will depend on your build configuration. However, with a standard setup, it will typically be created in the same directory as your main.cpp file.
